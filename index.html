            Steven Paul Jobs was an American business magnate, industrial designer, investor, and media proprietor. He
            was the chairman, chief executive officer (CEO), and co-founder of Apple Inc.; the chairman and majority
            shareholder of Pixar; a member of The Walt Disney Company's board of directors following its acquisition of
            Pixar; and the founder, chairman, and CEO of NeXT. Jobs is widely recognized as a pioneer of the personal
